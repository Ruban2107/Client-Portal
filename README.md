# Client Management Web Application

## Overview

The **Client Management Web Application** is designed to help businesses, particularly architectural firms, manage their clients, meetings, and associated projects. The app allows users to store client information, schedule meetings, track tasks, and maintain a clear record of client portfolios. This project is developed as part of a phase-end project to demonstrate skills in front-end development, database design, and project management using Agile methodologies.

The web application is built using **Angular** for the frontend, **MySQL** for data storage, and managed using **GitHub** for version control. It is structured to allow easy addition of clients, scheduling of client meetings, and viewing of project-related tasks.

## Features

- **Client Management**: Add, update, and view client details (e.g., name, email, phone).
- **Meeting Scheduling**: Schedule, update, and delete meetings with clients. View upcoming meetings.
- **Portfolio Management**: Track client projects and related tasks.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, designed for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Data Storage**: All client and meeting data is stored in a MySQL database for persistent data management.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - **Angular**: For building dynamic, responsive, and interactive user interfaces.
  - **HTML5, CSS3**: For layout and styling of the application.
  
- **Backend**:
  - **MySQL**: For storing and managing client and meeting data.

- **Version Control**:
  - **Git & GitHub**: For managing the codebase, version control, and collaboration.

- **Project Management**:
  - **Jira** (or any project management tool): For managing tasks and sprints in an Agile environment.

## Installation

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js**: Download and install from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **MySQL**: Install MySQL from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/).

### Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/client-management-web-app.git
```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd client-management-web-app
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the Angular development server:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

4. Open the browser and go to `http://localhost:4200` to view the application.

### Database Setup

1. Import the database schema into MySQL. You can find the SQL scripts under the `database-scripts/` folder.

Here is an example SQL script to create the **clients** and **meetings** tables:

```sql
-- Create table for clients
CREATE TABLE clients (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  email VARCHAR(100),
  phone VARCHAR(15),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Create table for meetings
CREATE TABLE meetings (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  client_id INT,
  meeting_date DATETIME,
  agenda TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY (client_id) REFERENCES clients(id)
);
```

2. Ensure MySQL is running and correctly connected to your Angular app's backend.




## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can:

1. **Add New Clients**:
   - Navigate to the "Clients" section and add a new client by filling in their details such as name, email, and phone number.
   
2. **Schedule Client Meetings**:
   - After adding a client, go to the "Meetings" section to schedule and track meetings with your clients.
   
3. **View Upcoming Meetings**:
   - View upcoming meetings and client interactions in the "Upcoming Meetings" section on the dashboard.

4. **Edit or Delete Clients and Meetings**:
   - Clients and meetings can be edited or deleted by accessing their respective details pages.
